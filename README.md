# test

## How to run

`cd back-end`

`npm install`

`npm start` - The application is running at localhost:8080

`npm run test` - Unit tests

`npm run dev` - Dev env

When I run npm install in the starter-project it show lot of errors. Due to the time constraint I end up create a new starter project with similar configurations (with some differents), which make it easier for me to understand a basic typescript nodejs app.

This is what i used in this test:

- ReactJS
- PostgreSQL: I create a db on Digital Ocean, the authentication are stored in .env file
